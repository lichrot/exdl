# [EXDL] Exoteric Description Language

An attempt at making a metasyntax: notation for context-free grammar.

This project aims at improving several pain-points of Backus-Naur Form (BNF):
- Make distinction between lexing unit (token) and parsing unit (rule)
- Create syntactical constructs for easier reading and writing by humans
- Allow for code splitting (importing and exporting tokens and rules)

## [Basics]
Tokens are defined with a `token` keyword:
```
token ampersand = "&"
```
NB: Tokens can be defined with any expression with the exeption of rules

Rules are defined with a `rule` keyword:
```
rule program = comment | function_declaration | type_declaration
```
NB: Tokens can (and should) be used to define rules.

Any token and/or rule can be exported and import:
```
// ./logical_operators.exdl
export token or = "|"
export token xor = "^"

// ./rules.exdl
import { xor, or } from "./logical_operators.exdl"

rule logical_operation = term ( xor | or ) term
```

## [Constructs]
To make writing language specifications easier, there are several constructs.

### [Set]
Sets (or unions) can be defined with a pipe `|` symbol, optionally being inclosed in parentheses `()`:
```
// sets containing single character
token plus  = "+"
token minus = "-"
// a set containing two tokens
token addition = plus | minus
// a set containing another set in addition to two tokens
token arithmetic = ( addition | "*" | "/" )
```

### [Map]
Maps (or enums) can be defined with a pipe `|` symbol, __strictly__ being inclosed in braces `{}`:
```
// Maps allow to namespace individual tokens/rules within itself
token whitespace = {
  | space   = " "
  | tab     = "\t"
  | newline = { posix = "\n" | win = "\r\n" }
}

token symbol = { slash = "/" }

rule comment = symbol.slash[2] char* whitespace.slash

// Strings can be used as a shorthand: keys will be equal to their expressions
token keyword = {
  | "inline"
  | "static"
  | qualifier = { "const" | "volatile" }
}
```
NB: When using a map by itself, it acts as a set containing all defined expression:
```
token pointer = ( "*" | "&" )
token pointer = { star = "*" | ampersand = "*" }
// These two declarations are equivalent
rule pointer_identifier = pointer identifier
```

### [Submap]
Submap is a syntactical sugar that allows to quickly constrain a map with given map keys:
```
token keyword = {
  | "inline"
  | "static"
  | "const"
  | "volatile"
  | qualifier = keyword.{ const | volatile }
}
```

### [Multipliers]
Each expression can be adorned with a regex-style multiplier symbols:
```
// ? - Zero or one (optional)
rule token_definition = keyword.export? keyword.token identifier symbol.equals expression

// * - Zero or more
rule inline_set = symbol.pipe? expression ( symbol.pipe syntax_rule )*

// + - One or more
rule identifier = char+ ( symbol.dot char+ )*

// [MIN(,MAX)?] - Minimum (and optionally maximum) number of characters
rule inline_comment = symbol.slash[2] char* whitespace.newline
```
